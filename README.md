# Snileposten

This is a website I made for my school Lillestrøm Videregående Skole (Norway). Each year my school hosts a roleplay that replicates the parliamentary elections in Norway. I volunteered to make a website for them.

This is the link to the website: [https://snileposten.vercel.app/](https://snileposten.vercel.app/)

The design for this website was made by some other students at my school. As they gave me the design, I integrated it into the website while giving them feedback about UX and mobile responsiveness. We worked together to make the website as good as possible.

These are the technologies I used to make the website:
- Next.js (React)
- HTML
- Tailwind CSS
- Headless CMS (Directus)
- GitHub & Git
